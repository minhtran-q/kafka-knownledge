## Feature
### Transaction
<details>
  <summary>Why does Kafka producer produce 2 offsets per message in <strong>transaction</strong> mode?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  This is a design of Kafka. When producer publish a message or a batch of messages, it adds a extra message as a commit message to complete a transaction.
  
  For example: 
  + The producer publish 10 messages, and the current offset will be 11.
  + The producer publish 1 message, and current offset will be 2
