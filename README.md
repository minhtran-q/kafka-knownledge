# Kafka knownledge
Kafka version: 3.1
## Kafka
Apache Kafka is a streaming platform that is free and open-source.
<details>
  <summary>Some features of Kafka</summary>
  <br/>
  
  + High-throughput: Kafka has a built-in patriation system known as a Topic
  + Fault-Tolerant: Kafka is resistant to node/machine failure within a cluster.
  + Durability: As Kafka supports messages replication, so,  messages are never lost. It is one of the reasons behind durability.
  + Scalability: Kafka can be scaled-out, without incurring any downtime on the fly by adding additional nodes.

## Broker

### Controller

<details>
  <summary>What is controller?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  A controller is not too complex — it is a normal broker that simply has additional responsibility. It's responsible for managing the state of all partitions and replicas
  
  For example:
  + When the leader partition fails, the controller is responsible for selecting a new leader replica for the partition.
  + When the ISR set of a partition changes, the controller is responsible for notifying all brokers to update their metadata information
  + When increasing the number of partitions for a topic, the controller is responsible for the reallocation of partitions.

## Feature
### Transaction
<details>
  <summary>Why does Kafka producer produce 2 offsets per message in <strong>transaction</strong> mode?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  This is a design of Kafka. When producer publish a message or a batch of messages, it adds a extra message as a commit message to complete a transaction.
  
  For example: 
  + The producer publish 10 messages, and the current offset will be 11.
  + The producer publish 1 message, and current offset will be 2
