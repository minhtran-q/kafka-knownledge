# Kafka knownledge
Kafka version: 3.1
## Kafka
Apache Kafka is a streaming platform that is free and open-source.
<details>
  <summary>Some features of Kafka</summary>
  <br/>
  
  + High-throughput: Kafka has a built-in patriation system known as a Topic
  + Fault-Tolerant: Kafka is resistant to node/machine failure within a cluster.
  + Durability: As Kafka supports messages replication, so,  messages are never lost. It is one of the reasons behind durability.
  + Scalability: Kafka can be scaled-out, without incurring any downtime on the fly by adding additional nodes.

## Zookeeper
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

<details>
  <summary>Why is Zookeeper necessary for Apache Kafka?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  Zookeeper has four primary functions
  1. **Controller Election**
  2. **Cluster Membership:** Zookeeper also maintains a list of all the brokers (ex: ISRs, ...)
  3. **Topic Configuration:** ZooKeeper maintains the configuration of all topics, including the list of existing topics, number of partitions for each topic, location of the replicas, configuration overrides for topics, preferred leader node, among other details.
  4. **Access Control Lists:** Access control lists or ACLs for all the topics

## Broker

### Controller

<details>
  <summary>What is controller?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  A controller is not too complex — it is a normal broker that simply has additional responsibility. It's responsible for managing the state of all partitions and replicas
  
  For example:
  + When the leader partition fails, the controller is responsible for selecting a new leader replica for the partition.
  + When the ISR set of a partition changes, the controller is responsible for notifying all brokers to update their metadata information
  + When increasing the number of partitions for a topic, the controller is responsible for the reallocation of partitions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Controller election</summary>
  <br/>

  When the controller goes down,
  1. Zookeeper informs all the brokers that the controller failed.
  2. All the brokers will apply to be the controller.
  3. The first broker who applies for this position will become the controller.

<details>
  <summary>__consumer_offsets topic</summary>
  <br/>

  Since 0.9v Kafka stores topic offsets on the broker directly instead of relying on Zookeeper.
  
  Offsets in Kafka are stored as messages in a separate topic named `__consumer_offsets` . Each consumer commits a message into the topic at periodic intervals.
  
  The **Consumer Groups** are stored in the `__consumer_offsets` topic. That topic contains both the committed offsets and the groups metadata (group.id, members, generation, leader, ...). Groups are stored using `GroupMetadataMessage` messages (Offsets use `OffsetsMessage`).
  
  _Dump the group metadata:_
  
  ```
  ./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --formatter "kafka.coordinator.group.GroupMetadataManager\$GroupMetadataMessageFormatter" \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic __consumer_offsets
  ```

## Feature
### Transaction
<details>
  <summary>Why does Kafka producer produce 2 offsets per message in <strong>transaction</strong> mode?</summary>
  <br/>
  
  This is a design of Kafka. When producer publish a message or a batch of messages, it adds a extra message as a commit message to complete a transaction.
  
  For example: 
  + The producer publish 10 messages, and the current offset will be 11.
  + The producer publish 1 message, and current offset will be 2
